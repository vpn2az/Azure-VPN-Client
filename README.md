## Introduction

Azure VPN Client is a Microsoft application designed to provide secure, reliable remote connectivity to Azure virtual networks. It enables users to establish encrypted VPN tunnels from Windows devices to organizational resources hosted in Azure, supporting modern remote work and hybrid access scenarios. The client is commonly used with Azure VPN Gateway, including point-to-site (P2S) configurations that rely on certificate-based authentication, Azure Active Directory authentication, or other enterprise-approved methods, depending on the gateway setup.

With Azure VPN Client, IT teams can distribute VPN profiles that include connection parameters, routing rules, DNS settings, and authentication requirements. Users then connect with a consistent interface and centralized configuration, reducing manual setup and minimizing misconfiguration risks. The client helps protect data in transit by leveraging strong encryption and secure tunneling, making it suitable for accessing internal applications, private APIs, and administrative endpoints.

Azure VPN Client also supports policy-driven connectivity where organizations can standardize access controls and align remote connections with security and compliance requirements. Combined with Azure networking features, it can be part of a broader Zero Trust strategy, ensuring that access is authenticated, authorized, and monitored. Whether connecting to development environments, production workloads, or internal services, Azure VPN Client delivers a professional, enterprise-grade solution for secure remote access to Azure-hosted resources.
